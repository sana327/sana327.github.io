							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Text is one of the main ways designers communicate with users (White, 2015). Typography
								sets the mood, tone, and style of the entire design (White, 2015). Audience needs to 
								be considered after deciding purpose of typography (White, 2015). Visual hiearchy is 
								important to improve readability (White, 2015). Readability, legibility, and purpose are
								principles to keep in mind when choosing a type of font; researching into
								the font's intended purpose is also a good idea (White, 2015). </p>

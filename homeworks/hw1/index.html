        <p> Hello, nice to meet you! Besides singing badly, I love to 
            eat greasy food and stare at plants. This year I'd like to 
            try out new foods like sushi, non-microwavable ramen, etc.
            and finally adopt a plant of my own! 
        </p>

                <li>I learned that the design of an apps' features are intentional in terms
                    of content, appearance, and location (Warner, 2018). These factors serve to guide
                    a user's focus while using the app (Warner, 2018).
                </li>
                <li>I liked how the author provided four "takeaway" concepts and
                    described them in detail. Warner highlighted the topics of 
                    hierarchy, content, intent, and audience (2018).
                </li>
                <li>I found the following quote to be compelling: "By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll develop 
                    product thinking and get better at desingning apps yourself" (Warner, 2018).
                </li>
                <li>On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give reading this article a 9; the 
                    gifs showing step-by-step transitions of design elements (Warner, 2018) were
                    really effective in getting Warner's message across.
